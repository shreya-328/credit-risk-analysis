# Credit Risk Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze credit risk by predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default. Using the Kaggle Credit Risk Dataset, the goal is to apply data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to uncover insights and build a predictive model that supports lending decisions.
